Jetpack Compose is just awesome. It saves lots of hours and produce nice UI with minimal effort. But few things like:
- Navigation
- Modal bottom sheet handling
- Permission request and check
- Resulting activity handling like camera, gallery etc
- Back press handling
- Soft input mode management
- UI reusability across multiple viewModels

are still weird because they need to be handled directly from composable UI code, but viewModel need to handle these things.

Jerokit offers very easy mechanisms to manage these things directly from viewModel.
