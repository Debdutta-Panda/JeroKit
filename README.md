Jetpack Compose is just awesome. It saves lots of hours and produce nice UI with minimal effort. But few things like:
- Navigation
- Modal bottom sheet handling
- Permission request and check
- Resulting activity handling like camera, gallery etc
- Back press handling
- Soft input mode management
- UI reusability across multiple viewModels
is still weird or not smooth

Jerokit addressed those problems and offers smooth coding in viewModl to manage all the above points from viewModel
